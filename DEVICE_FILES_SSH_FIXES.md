# Device Files Screen - SSH File Management Fixes

## Issue Summary
The Device Files Screen was experiencing failures when attempting to delete files or perform other file management operations through SSH connections. The primary issues were:

1. **SSH Session Hanging**: Commands would hang indefinitely
2. **Improper Error Handling**: Failed operations weren't properly caught
3. **Incomplete Session Management**: SSH sessions weren't being properly managed

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: SSH Session Lifecycle Management
The original `_executeCommand` method had a critical flaw in how it handled SSH sessions:

```dart
// PROBLEMATIC CODE:
final session = await widget.sshClient!.execute(command);
final exitCode = await session.exitCode;  // This could hang indefinitely
```

The issue was waiting for `exitCode` before consuming the stdout/stderr streams, which could cause the session to hang if the command produced output.

### Secondary Issues
1. **Upload Method**: Using unreliable base64 encoding without chunking for large files
2. **Error Handling**: Insufficient validation and error reporting
3. **File Operations**: No path validation for dangerous operations

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed SSH Command Execution (`_executeCommand`)

**Before:**
```dart
Future<void> _executeCommand(String command) async {
  final session = await widget.sshClient!.execute(command);
  final exitCode = await session.exitCode;  // Could hang here
  
  if (exitCode != 0) {
    final errorOutput = await session.stderr.cast<List<int>>().transform(utf8.decoder).join();
    throw Exception('Command failed (exit code $exitCode): $errorOutput');
  }
}
```

**After:**
```dart
Future<void> _executeCommand(String command) async {
  final session = await widget.sshClient!.execute(command);
  
  // Consume stdout and stderr first to prevent hanging
  final stdout = await session.stdout.cast<List<int>>().transform(utf8.decoder).join();
  final stderr = await session.stderr.cast<List<int>>().transform(utf8.decoder).join();
  
  // Now check exit code
  final exitCode = await session.exitCode;
  
  if (exitCode != 0) {
    throw Exception('Command failed (exit code $exitCode): ${stderr.isNotEmpty ? stderr : stdout}');
  }
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- Consume stdout/stderr streams before checking exit code
- Prevents session hanging by ensuring all output is read
- Better error reporting using both stdout and stderr

### 2. Enhanced File Upload Method

**Improvements:**
- Added SFTP as primary upload method with base64 fallback
- Implemented file chunking for large files to avoid command line limits
- Better error handling and recovery

```dart
Future<void> _uploadFile(File localFile, String remotePath) async {
  try {
    // Try SFTP first (more reliable)
    final sftp = await widget.sshClient!.sftp();
    final content = await localFile.readAsBytes();
    final remoteFile = await sftp.open(remotePath, mode: SftpFileOpenMode.create | SftpFileOpenMode.write);
    await remoteFile.write(Stream.value(content));
    await remoteFile.close();
  } catch (e) {
    // Fallback to base64 with chunking
    final content = await localFile.readAsBytes();
    const chunkSize = 4096;
    // ... chunked upload implementation
  }
}
```

### 3. Improved Delete Operations

**Enhanced Safety and Error Handling:**
- Added path validation to prevent dangerous deletions
- Individual error handling for each file/folder
- Better error messages for debugging

```dart
for (final entry in selectedEntries) {
  final path = _currentPath == '/' ? '/${entry.name}' : '$_currentPath/${entry.name}';
  
  // Validate path to prevent dangerous operations
  if (path == '/' || path.isEmpty || path == _currentPath) {
    throw Exception('Cannot delete: Invalid path "$path"');
  }
  
  try {
    if (entry.isDir) {
      await _executeCommand('rm -rf "${path.replaceAll('"', '\\"')}"');
    } else {
      await _executeCommand('rm -f "${path.replaceAll('"', '\\"')}"');
    }
  } catch (e) {
    throw Exception('Failed to delete "${entry.name}": $e');
  }
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Copy/Move Operations

**Improvements:**
- Individual error handling for each operation
- Better error messages identifying which files failed
- Proper cleanup on failures

## Technical Details

### SSH Session Management Best Practices
1. **Always consume output streams before checking exit codes**
2. **Handle both stdout and stderr appropriately**
3. **Use timeouts for operations that might hang**
4. **Proper resource cleanup with try-catch-finally patterns**

### Command Safety
- Path escaping to prevent command injection
- Input validation for dangerous operations
- Explicit path validation for delete operations

### Error Recovery
- Graceful fallbacks (SFTP → base64)
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Individual operation error handling

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Delete Operations**: Test deleting individual files and folders
2. **Upload Operations**: Test uploading small and large files
3. **Copy/Move Operations**: Test clipboard operations
4. **Error Scenarios**: Test with invalid paths and permissions

### Automated Testing
```dart
// Example test for delete operation
test('delete file operation', () async {
  final mockSSH = MockSSHClient();
  // Setup mock responses
  await fileScreen.deleteSelected();
  verify(mockSSH.execute('rm -f "/test/file.txt"')).called(1);
});
```

## Results
After implementing these fixes:

✅ **File deletion now works reliably**  
✅ **Upload operations complete without hanging**  
✅ **Copy/move operations function correctly**  
✅ **Better error messages for debugging**  
✅ **Improved safety with path validation**  

## Future Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Parallel Operations**: Execute multiple file operations concurrently
2. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress for large operations
3. **Caching**: Cache directory listings for faster navigation

### Enhanced Error Handling
1. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures
2. **Partial Success Handling**: Continue operations even if some files fail
3. **User-friendly Error Messages**: Convert technical errors to user-friendly messages

### Additional Features
1. **File Verification**: Verify file integrity after upload/copy
2. **Atomic Operations**: Ensure operations complete fully or rollback
3. **Batch Operations**: Optimize multiple file operations

The fixes ensure reliable file management operations while maintaining the modern UI and comprehensive feature set of the enhanced Device Files Screen.
