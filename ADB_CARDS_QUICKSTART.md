# Quick Start: Testing the Enhanced ADB Cards

## Option 1: Add to Device Misc Screen (Recommended)

Add a new card to your device misc screen to access the preview:

1. Open `lib/screens/device_misc_screen.dart`

2. Add this import at the top:
```dart
import 'adb_cards_preview_screen.dart';
```

3. Add a new card in the GridView (after the existing cards):
```dart
EnhancedMiscCard(
  title: 'ADB Cards Preview',
  description: 'Preview new enhanced ADB device cards',
  icon: Icons.preview,
  primaryColor: Colors.purple,
  onTap: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const AdbCardsPreviewScreen(),
      ),
    );
  },
  badge: 'NEW',
  badgeColor: Colors.green,
  quickAction: 'View',
  onQuickAction: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const AdbCardsPreviewScreen(),
      ),
    );
  },
),
```

## Option 2: Add to Settings Screen

Add a button in your settings screen:

1. Open `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`

2. Add import:
```dart
import 'adb_cards_preview_screen.dart';
```

3. Add a ListTile in the settings:
```dart
ListTile(
  leading: const Icon(Icons.preview),
  title: const Text('ADB Cards Preview'),
  subtitle: const Text('Preview new enhanced device cards'),
  trailing: const Chip(
    label: Text('NEW'),
    backgroundColor: Colors.green,
  ),
  onTap: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const AdbCardsPreviewScreen(),
      ),
    );
  },
),
```

## Option 3: Add to Home Screen

Add a temporary button to your home screen:

1. Open `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`

2. Add import:
```dart
import 'adb_cards_preview_screen.dart';
```

3. Add a FloatingActionButton or IconButton in your AppBar:
```dart
// In AppBar actions:
IconButton(
  icon: const Icon(Icons.preview),
  tooltip: 'Preview ADB Cards',
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const AdbCardsPreviewScreen(),
      ),
    );
  },
),
```

## Option 4: Temporary Route in Main

For quick testing, add a temporary route:

1. Open `lib/main.dart`

2. Add import:
```dart
import 'screens/adb_cards_preview_screen.dart';
```

3. Add route to your MaterialApp:
```dart
MaterialApp(
  // ... other properties
  routes: {
    '/adb-preview': (context) => const AdbCardsPreviewScreen(),
    // ... other routes
  },
)
```

4. Navigate from anywhere:
```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/adb-preview');
```

## What You'll See

The preview screen shows 8 sample devices demonstrating all features:

1. **Pixel 8 Pro** - Online Wi-Fi device with 25ms latency (favorite, Work group)
2. **Galaxy Tab S8** - Offline Wi-Fi tablet (Test group)
3. **Fire TV Stick** - Online TV with 180ms latency (orange status)
4. **OnePlus 12** - USB device with 5ms latency (favorite, Home group)
5. **Development Tablet** - Paired device, not tested (Work group)
6. **Android Auto** - Custom connection, connecting state (animated)
7. **Wear OS Watch** - Online watch with 45ms latency
8. **Unknown Device** - Offline generic device

## Features to Test

- ✅ Group badges (Work, Home, Test)
- ✅ Status chips with latency
- ✅ Last used relative time (Just now, 2m ago, 1h ago, etc.)

### Quick Actions
- ✅ Edit button (shows snackbar)
- ✅ Delete button (shows snackbar)
- ✅ Connect button (shows snackbar)

### Floating Action Button
- ✅ "Add Device" button at bottom right

## Next Steps After Testing

Once you've verified the cards look and work well:

1. **Phase 2**: Integrate into actual ADB screen
   - Replace current device list with enhanced cards
   - Add search and filter functionality
   - Implement real connection logic

2. **Phase 3**: Create connection wizard
   - Step-by-step device pairing
   - Form validation
   - Test connection before saving

3. **Phase 4**: Add batch operations
   - Connect multiple devices
   - Delete multiple devices
   - Export/import configurations

## Customization

Want to test different appearances? Edit sample devices in `adb_cards_preview_screen.dart`:

```dart
_SampleDevice(
  name: 'Your Device Name',
  address: '192.168.1.XXX:5555',
  deviceType: AdbDeviceType.phone, // or tablet, tv, watch, auto, other
  connectionType: AdbConnectionType.wifi, // or usb, paired, custom
  status: AdbDeviceStatus.online, // or offline, connecting, notTested
  group: 'Your Group',
  isFavorite: true,
  lastUsed: DateTime.now(),
  latencyMs: 25,
  subtitle: 'Custom subtitle text',
),
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cards too small/large?
Adjust `childAspectRatio` in `adb_cards_preview_screen.dart`:
```dart
gridDelegate: SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(
  crossAxisCount: crossAxisCount,
  childAspectRatio: 0.85, // Increase for wider cards, decrease for taller
  // ...
),
```

### Text overflow?
Check that device names and addresses aren't too long. Cards automatically truncate with ellipsis.

### Hover effects not working?
Make sure you're testing on desktop with a mouse. Touch devices don't have hover.

### Animations laggy?
This is normal in debug mode. Try profile or release builds:
```bash
flutter run --profile
# or
flutter run --release
```

## Feedback

After testing, consider:
- Is the card size appropriate?
- Are the colors/status indicators clear?
- Is the information hierarchy easy to read?
- Do hover effects feel smooth?
- Are quick actions easy to find?
- Is multi-select mode intuitive?
