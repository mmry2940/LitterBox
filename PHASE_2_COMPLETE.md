### Before (Old Dashboard)
- Single cramped Card with everything inside
- Connection form + mDNS results + USB devices + saved devices all mixed
- Basic ListTile for saved devices
- Only "All" vs "Favorites" filter
- No search functionality
- Limited sorting (Alphabetical/Last Used/Pinned)
- Batch operations buried in UI
- Discovery results in small 120px ListView

### After (Enhanced Dashboard)
- Clean 3-tab segmented interface
- Separated concerns: Saved / Discovered / New Connection
- Enhanced Material 3 cards with metadata
- Search bar with real-time filtering
- Filter and sort dropdowns

- Discovery in spacious grids with enhanced cards
- Device labels/groups displayed prominently
- Last used relative timestamps
- Status indicators (not fully implemented yet)
- Quick actions on hover (Edit/Delete/Connect)

## 🔄 Data Flow

### Saved Devices
1. **Load** → Dashboard receives `savedDevices` list from parent
2. **Filter** → Applied based on `connectionFilter` and `searchQuery`
3. **Sort** → Applied based on `sortOption`
4. **Render** → Grid of Enhanced ADB Device Cards
5. **Actions** → Callbacks to parent: `onLoadDevice`, `onEditDevice`, `onDeleteDevice`, `onToggleFavorite`

### Discovered Devices
1. **Scan** → User taps "Scan Wi-Fi" or "Refresh USB"
2. **Update** → Parent updates `mdnsServices` or `usbDevices`
3. **Render** → Grid of discovery cards
4. **Connect** → Quick connect via `onConnectWifi` or `onConnectUsb`

### Multi-Select Batch Operations
1. **Toggle** → User enables multi-select mode
2. **Select** → Checkboxes appear, user selects devices
3. **Batch Action** → "Connect Selected" or "Delete Selected"
4. **Confirm** → Delete shows confirmation dialog
5. **Execute** → Actions applied to all selected devices

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### Discoverability
- **Clearer sections**: Saved vs Discovered vs New separated
- **Visual hierarchy**: Enhanced cards with icons and status
- **Empty states**: Helpful prompts when no devices

### Efficiency
- **Search**: Find devices instantly by name/IP/group
- **Filters**: Quick access to favorites
- **Batch ops**: Connect or delete multiple devices at once
- **Quick actions**: Edit/Delete/Connect on hover

### Clarity
- **Status indicators**: Visual feedback on device state
- **Timestamps**: See when devices were last used
- **Labels/Groups**: Organize devices with custom tags
- **Connection types**: Clear badges (Wi-Fi/USB/Paired/Custom)

### Responsiveness
- **Adaptive grid**: 1 column mobile → 4 columns desktop
- **Touch-friendly**: Large tap targets on mobile
- **Hover effects**: Desktop users see scale and actions
